# Classic Simon Game

A remake of the classic electronic game of memory.  The game creates random sequences of color and sounds that the user must repeat.  If the user succeeds in repeating the sequence the game becomes progressively more difficult.  If the user fails the game is over, but you can always play again!


## Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery


## What I learned building Simon

*  A more solid understanding of passing data from one function to another. <br/>

* Overall more comfort with Javascript and jQuery. <br/>

* The jQuery() and the object it creates and the reference it holds of HTML elements. <br/>

*  Getting information vs setting information from single/multiple elements such as:
    * If a jQuery selection holds more than one element and a method is used to get info it will only retrieve from the first element. <br/>
    * To get the content of all the elements use ```.each()``` method. <br/>
    * Similary if jQuery selection holds more than one element and a method is used to update it...it will update all. <br/>
    * The ```.each()``` method recreates the functionality of a loop in Javascript. <br/>

* ```this``` keyword and how it references to the object that the function is created inside i.e., window object, containing object, or object it is contained within.
